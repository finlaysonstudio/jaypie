# Technical Examples and Reference Documentation in README.md

Technical documentation is best presented with heavy use of examples for common uses and thorough explanation of available options for advanced users.

## 🔧 Maintenance Checklist (Outputs)

Validate code examples against the current codebase.
Make sure each exported value is correct and documentation is current.
Write new documentation for sections as needed or directed.
Verify reference links point to the latest documentation.
Ensure formatting consistency with technical examples and references.
Check markdown syntax.

### 📥 Task Prerequisites (Inputs)

Existing README files serve as the baseline.
If only code is provided, update the README with accurate technical examples.
If a README is absent, inspect project directories before generating one.
Establish clarity and consistency with the surrounding documentation context.

## ✍️ Editorial Guidelines

Adhere to the existing heading hierarchy.
Refrain from modifying established sections.
Maintain the style, tone, and technical formatting already in use.
Avoid adding emojis if the current document does not use them.

## 📋 Suggested Outline

If the document does not have a section for technical documentation, use `## Reference` or `## 📖 Reference` if those are not already in use.

Use consistent whitespace to separate content.
Place each sentence on its own line to enhance version control diffs.

## 🧑‍💻 Technical Audience

Assume a background in software development.
Assume that the audience is technical and capable of following explicit instructions.
Include code examples as necessary.
Declare required import statements at the beginning of example blocks.

## 🏠 Studio House Style

Adhere to the Chicago Manual of Style.
Focus on clarity using terse and pithy language.
Apply whitespace around headings to reduce visual clutter.
Place each sentence on its own line to enhance version control diffs.
Apply business formal language with dry whimsy when appropriate.
Emojis may introduce second-level headings and conclude first- or third-level headings as appropriate.
Avoid the second-person pronoun; instructions may imply the reader without using “you.”
Reference abstract third persons when a party must be mentioned.
