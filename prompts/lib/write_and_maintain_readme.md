# Write and Maintain an Engaging README.md

Engaging READMEs invite all audiences to explore the contents.
They present documentation in an accessible and organized manner.

## 🔧 Maintenance Checklist (Outputs)

Ensure all spelling and grammar have been checked.
Confirm that all external links operate without redirection.
Verify that external links land on meaningful pages.
Check markdown syntax.

## 📥 Task Prerequisites (Inputs)

Most repositories contain an existing README.
If only a README is provided, review and maintain it without considering drift from the code.
If code is included, review the provided code and update the README accordingly.
If no README is present, verify that a README.md file exists before creating a new one.

## ✍️ Editorial Guidelines

Adhere to the existing heading hierarchy.
Refrain from modifying established sections.
Maintain the style, tone, and technical formatting already in use.
Avoid adding emojis if the current document does not use them.

## 📋 Suggested Outline

Structure the document so that the content flows from the most common audience's high-level needs to a complete reference.
Avoid creating empty sections.

```markdown
# Document Title
Description // a tagline or tl;dr that extends beyond the title
## ✈️ Overview – an introduction for documents of extensive length
## 💿 Installation - or ## 💿 Setup
## 📋 Usage – a quick overview of the most common uses
## 📖 Reference – a detailed guide to all uses, ideally arranged alphabetically
## 💻 Development – instructions for setting up a local environment
## 🚀 Deployment – guidelines for deploying to staging and production environments
## 🛣️ Roadmap
## 📝 Changelog
## 📎 Appendix - or ## 🖇️ Footnotes as needed
## 📜 License – typically defaulting to “All rights reserved.” unless specified otherwise
```

## 🧑‍💻 Technical Audience

Assume that the audience is technical and capable of following explicit instructions.
Include code examples as necessary.
Declare required import statements at the beginning of example blocks.

## 🏠 Studio House Style

Adhere to the Chicago Manual of Style.
Focus on clarity using terse and pithy language.
Apply whitespace around headings to reduce visual clutter.
Place each sentence on its own line to enhance version control diffs.
Apply business formal language with dry whimsy when appropriate.
Emojis may introduce second-level headings and conclude first- or third-level headings as appropriate.
Avoid the second-person pronoun; instructions may imply the reader without using “you.”
Reference abstract third persons when a party must be mentioned.
