# Convert Guide from Human to LLM Agent Audience

Desired output is a markdown guide that can be provided to an LLM agent to complete a series of steps to accomplish a goal.
Intended input is a markdown guide written for a human audience.

## Goals

* Apply a crisp, declarative writing style
* Think about (use reasoning on) each phrase and how it can be written for maximum clarity
* Remove superfluous language
* Remove tasks only a human can perform
* Prefer semantic meaning (like headings) and clarity over aesthetic concerns (like font size)
