# Debugging TypeScript Type Compatibility Issues

Provide the simplest fix by altering the fewest exported types.

## ðŸ“¥ Task Prerequisites (Inputs)

If a problem statement is not provided, see if it can be ascertained via linting and testing. 

## ðŸ“‹ Suggested Process

* Record results of linting and testing the project to establish a baseline.
* Identify the simplest change by altering as few exported types as possible.
* Read the error messages carefully to understand which types are incompatible.
* Check which types are being exported and where they might be used incorrectly.
* Pinpoint the file(s) throwing the type incompatibility error.
* Update one type or a small group of related types at a time.
* Run lint and tests to verify no new issues are introduced.

## ðŸ“Œ Remember

Do not convert a JavaScript project to TypeScript. 
Work on one task at a time.
Focus on subpackages when used in a monorepo.
Confine changes to requested scope.
Ensure the whole type system is not being overhauled.

## ðŸ“¤ Status Report (Outputs)

Once all issues are resolved, summarize:

* Every file where modifications were made.
* For each type altered (directly or indirectly), describe:
  * The change made (e.g., adjusting an interface property, updating union types).
  * The impact of the change (e.g., improved compatibility, resolved error messages).
* Any new issues introduced in linting or tests.
