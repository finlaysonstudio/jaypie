# Reorganize Jaypie Mock Structure

## Objective
The Jaypie mock is one of the best things about the Jaypie library but it needed reorganization. This change creates a more modular, maintainable, and future-proof mock system.

## Implementation

1. Created modular mock system in `packages/testkit/src/mock/` directory
2. Split monolithic `jaypie.mock.ts` (1180+ lines) into smaller focused modules:
   - `utils.ts`: Helper functions for creating mocks
   - `setup.ts`: Test environment setup/teardown utilities
   - `core.ts`: Core mock functionality (validation, config, logger)
   - `aws.ts`: AWS service mocks
   - `express.ts`: Express framework mocks
   - `llm.ts`: LLM functionality mocks
   - `datadog.ts`: Datadog metrics mocks
   - `lambda.ts`: AWS Lambda mocks
   - `mongoose.ts`: Mongoose database mocks
   - `textract.ts`: Textract document processing mocks
3. Created index.ts to re-export all mocks
4. Updated package.json exports configuration
5. Updated rollup.config.js to build the new structure
6. Added comprehensive unit tests for all mock modules

## Benefits

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Smaller, focused files are easier to understand and modify
2. **Better Organization**: Clear separation of concerns with dedicated files for each domain
3. **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Easier to find and use specific mocks
4. **Future-Proofing**: Structure allows for easier addition of new mock modules
5. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive tests for each mock module
6. **Consistent API**: Standardized approach to creating and using mocks across domains

## Next Steps

1. Update documentation to reflect the new mock system organization
2. Gradually deprecate the old mock file
3. Update existing tests to use the new mock imports

Note: The original `packages/testkit/src/jaypie.mock.ts` file has been preserved as requested in the original task.
