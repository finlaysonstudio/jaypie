# Add JaypieLambda Construct

packages/constructs/src/JaypieQueuedLambda.ts
packages/constructs/src/__tests__/JaypieQueuedLambda.spec.ts

JaypieQueuedLambda blends a queue, and a lambda with some "jaypie conveniences" like tags and secret management. I'd like to create a new JaypieLambda that implements lambda.iFunction and takes all the same props except the queue settings.
