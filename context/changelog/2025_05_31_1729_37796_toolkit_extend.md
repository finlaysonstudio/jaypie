Add an `extend(tools: [], options)` to Toolkit that adds each tool to the toolkit.
Return this to allow chaining but do not create a new instance.
Add a test that works with a simple addition of new tools.
If there is a tool that already has that name, log a warning but replace the outdated tool.
Add a test that confirms replacement.
If options.warn is false, skip the warning; test.
If options.replace is false, do not replace the old tool and ignore the new tool; test.
If options.log is present, replace this.log (e.g., if there was a custom function and log is true, the original function will be used); test.
If options.explain is present, replace this.explain.
