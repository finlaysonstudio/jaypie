# Fix validate mock

## Problem Statement

The `packages/testkit/src/jaypie.mock.ts` file provides a mock for all of Jaypie but was missing the `validate` function from `packages/core/src/lib/arguments/validate.function.js`.

## Changes

1. Added the `validate` function to the Jaypie mock, including all of its convenience methods and sub-objects
2. Created comprehensive tests for the mock `validate` function to ensure it behaves like the original
3. Set up the mock to use the real implementation but with the ability to spy on calls and provide mock returns

## Testing

Added a complete test suite that covers:
- Basic validation functionality
- Convenience methods (validate.string, validate.number, etc.)
- Optional methods (validate.optional.string, etc.)
- Mocking capabilities for testing

All tests pass and the mock implementation behaves just like the original `validate` function.
