Consider the previous feature plan and the implementation.
I would like to create a feature that allows me to supplement group policies.
I would like to add additional option, `inlinePolicyStatements` that takes an object with keys `administrators`, `analysts`, `developers`.

Example:

```typescript
import { JaypieSsoGroups } from "@jaypie/constructs";

const ssoGroups = new JaypieSsoGroups(this, id, {
  instanceArn,
  accountMap: {
    development: ["123456789012"],
    management: ["234567890123"],
    operations: ["345678901234"],
    production: ["456789012345"],
    sandbox: ["567890123456"],
    security: ["678901234567"],
    stage: ["789012345678"],
  },
  groupMap: {
    administrators: "c4f87458-e021-7053-669c-4dc2a2ceaadf",
    analysts: "949844c8-60b1-7046-0328-9ad0806336f1",
    developers: "5488a468-5031-7001-64d6-9ba1f377ee6d",
  },
  inlinePolicyStatements: {
    administrators: [
      {
        Effect: "Allow",
        Action: [
          "ce:*",
        ],
        Resource: "*",
      },
    ]
  }
});
```
