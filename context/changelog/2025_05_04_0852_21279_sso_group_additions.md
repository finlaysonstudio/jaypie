Consider the previous feature plan and the implementation.
I would like to create a feature that allows me to supplement group policies.
I would like to add additional option, `inlinePolicyStatements` that takes an object with keys `administrators`, `analysts`, `developers`.

Example:

```typescript
import { JaypieSsoGroups } from "@jaypie/constructs";

const ssoGroups = new JaypieSsoGroups(this, id, {
  instanceArn,
  accountMap: {
    development: ["123456789012"],
    management: ["234567890123"],
    operations: ["345678901234"],
    production: ["456789012345"],
    sandbox: ["567890123456"],
    security: ["678901234567"],
    stage: ["789012345678"],
  },
  groupMap: {
    administrators: "c4f87458-e021-7053-669c-4dc2a2ceaadf",
    analysts: "949844c8-60b1-7046-0328-9ad0806336f1",
    developers: "5488a468-5031-7001-64d6-9ba1f377ee6d",
  },
  inlinePolicyStatements: {
    administrators: [
      {
        Effect: "Allow",
        Action: [
          "ce:*",
        ],
        Resource: "*",
      },
    ]
  }
});
```

# Project Plan: Add Inline Policy Statements to JaypieSsoGroups

## Overview

This project extends the `JaypieSsoGroups` construct in the `@jaypie/constructs` package to allow for supplementary group policies. A new option, `inlinePolicyStatements`, will be added to the constructor parameters, enabling users to define additional policy statements for each group type (administrators, analysts, developers).

## Current Implementation

The `JaypieSsoGroups` construct creates three permission sets with predefined policies:
1. **Administrator** - Full administrative access with AdministratorAccess policy
2. **Analyst** - Read-only access with limited write permissions
3. **Developer** - System administrator access with expanded write access

Each permission set has fixed inline policies defined in the implementation. The construct then assigns these permission sets to different AWS accounts based on the account and group mappings provided.

## Proposed Enhancement

Add a new optional property `inlinePolicyStatements` to `JaypieSsoGroupsProps` that allows users to provide additional IAM policy statements for each group type. These statements will be merged with the existing inline policies for each permission set.

## Tasks

Tasks should be labeled _Queued_, _Dequeued_, and _Verified_
Consider unlabeled tasks _Queued_
Once development begins, mark a task _Dequeued_
Do not move tasks to _Verified_ during the development process
A separate verification process will tag tasks _Verified_
The "first" or "next" task refers to the top-most _Queued_ task
The "last" or "previous" task refers to the bottom-most _Dequeued_ task
Only work on one task at a time
Only work on the next task unless instructed to work on the last task

1. _Dequeued_ Update JaypieSsoGroupsProps interface
   - Modify `packages/constructs/src/JaypieSsoGroups.ts` to add the new optional `inlinePolicyStatements` property
   - Create appropriate TypeScript interfaces for the policy statements
   - Update JSDoc comments for the interface

2. _Dequeued_ Implement policy merging functionality
   - Add helper functions to merge the default inline policies with user-provided statements
   - Ensure policies are properly formatted according to AWS IAM policy requirements
   - Handle undefined/empty user policies gracefully

3. _Dequeued_ Update permission set creation methods
   - Modify `createAdministratorPermissionSet()`, `createAnalystPermissionSet()`, and `createDeveloperPermissionSet()` to use the new merged policies
   - Ensure backward compatibility for users not providing `inlinePolicyStatements`

4. _Dequeued_ Update unit tests
   - Add tests in `packages/constructs/src/__tests__/JaypieSsoGroups.spec.ts` for the new functionality
   - Test with inline policy statements for each group type
   - Test edge cases (empty statements, undefined values, etc.)
   - Verify that existing tests still pass

5. _Dequeued_ Update README.md
   - Document the new `inlinePolicyStatements` property in the README
   - Add examples showing how to use the new functionality
   - Explain the merging behavior with default policies

## Code Examples

### Updated JaypieSsoGroupsProps Interface

```typescript
export interface JaypieSsoGroupsProps {
  /**
   * ARN of the IAM Identity Center instance
   */
  instanceArn: string;

  /**
   * Mapping of account categories to AWS account IDs
   */
  accountMap: JaypieSsoAccountMap;

  /**
   * Mapping of group types to Google Workspace group GUIDs
   */
  groupMap: JaypieSsoGroupMap;
  
  /**
   * Additional inline policy statements to append to each group's permission set
   * Each group can have its own set of policy statements that will be merged
   * with the default policies.
   */
  inlinePolicyStatements?: {
    administrators?: PolicyStatement[];
    analysts?: PolicyStatement[];
    developers?: PolicyStatement[];
  };
}

/**
 * IAM Policy Statement structure for inline policies
 */
export interface PolicyStatement {
  Effect: "Allow" | "Deny";
  Action: string[] | string;
  Resource: string[] | string;
  Condition?: Record<string, any>;
}
```

### Expected Usage

```typescript
import { JaypieSsoGroups } from "@jaypie/constructs";

const ssoGroups = new JaypieSsoGroups(this, id, {
  instanceArn,
  accountMap: {
    development: ["123456789012"],
    management: ["234567890123"],
    operations: ["345678901234"],
    production: ["456789012345"],
    sandbox: ["567890123456"],
    security: ["678901234567"],
    stage: ["789012345678"],
  },
  groupMap: {
    administrators: "c4f87458-e021-7053-669c-4dc2a2ceaadf",
    analysts: "949844c8-60b1-7046-0328-9ad0806336f1",
    developers: "5488a468-5031-7001-64d6-9ba1f377ee6d",
  },
  inlinePolicyStatements: {
    administrators: [
      {
        Effect: "Allow",
        Action: [
          "ce:*",
        ],
        Resource: "*",
      },
    ]
  }
});
```

### Implementation Approach for Policy Merging

```typescript
private mergeInlinePolicies(
  defaultPolicy: Record<string, any>,
  additionalStatements?: PolicyStatement[]
): Record<string, any> {
  if (!additionalStatements || additionalStatements.length === 0) {
    return defaultPolicy;
  }

  const mergedPolicy = {
    ...defaultPolicy,
    Statement: [
      ...defaultPolicy.Statement,
      ...additionalStatements,
    ],
  };

  return mergedPolicy;
}
```

## Implementation Notes

1. The implementation should maintain backward compatibility
2. User-provided policy statements should be appended to the default statements
3. The structure should follow AWS CDK patterns for IAM policies
4. Proper validation should be in place to ensure policy format is correct
5. Tests should verify that the merged policies appear correctly in CloudFormation templates
