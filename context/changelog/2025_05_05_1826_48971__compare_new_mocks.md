#  Compare New Mocks

An old package was recently refactored.

This is the package:
packages/testkit/src/jaypie.mock.ts

This is the location of the refactoring:
packages/testkit/src/mock/

Go through each file in the refactored mock.

Append `---` to this file and output a report detailing:
* Are any functions available in the original mock missing from the new mock? (we will probably fix later)
* Does the new mock have any new functions? (this can be good)
* Are any of the implementations of the new mock different from the old mocks? This can be as simple as the return value being different
