# Mock Comparison Report

## Missing Functions

The following functions from the original mock are missing in the new implementation:

1. **AWS Related:**
   - `getEnvSecret`
   - `getSingletonMessage`
   - `getTextractJob`
   - `sendBatchMessages`
   - `sendTextractJob`

2. **Core Error Classes:**
   - Most of the error classes are missing in the new implementation (BadGatewayError, BadRequestError, etc.)
   - The new implementation only has `MockValidationError` and `MockNotFoundError`

3. **Core Functions:**
   - `cloneDeep`
   - `envBoolean`
   - `envsKey`
   - `errorFromStatusCode`
   - `formatError`
   - `getHeaderFrom`
   - `getObjectKeyCaseInsensitive` 
   - `isClass`
   - `isJaypieError`
   - `optional` (and its sub-functions)
   - `required` (and its sub-functions)
   - `safeParseFloat`
   - `placeholders`
   - `jaypieHandler`
   - `sleep`
   - `uuid`

4. **Express Routes:**
   - `badRequestRoute` 
   - `echoRoute`
   - `forbiddenRoute`
   - `goneRoute`
   - `methodNotAllowedRoute`
   - `noContentRoute`
   - `notFoundRoute`
   - `notImplementedRoute`
   - `expressHttpCodeHandler`
   - `expressHandler`

5. **LLM Functions:**
   - `toolkit`
   - `tools`
   - `random`
   - `roll`
   - `time`
   - `weather`
   - The new implementation has `operate` but not the `Llm` class structure

6. **Textract Functions:**
   - `MarkdownPage`
   - `textractJsonToMarkdown`

## New Functions

The new implementation adds several new functions and utilities:

1. **Core Utilities:**
> These are fine but do not export them
   - `createMockFunction` - A typed wrapper around vi.fn()
   - `createAutoMocks` - Automatically creates mocks from original implementations
   - `createDeepMock` - Creates nested mock objects

2. **AWS Functions:**
> These are incorrect; delete them
   - `uploadToS3`
   - `downloadFromS3`

3. **Express Utilities:**
> These are incorrect; delete them
   - `mockRequest` - Creates a mock Express request
   - `mockResponse` - Creates a mock Express response
   - `mockNext` - Creates a mock Express next function
   - `mockRouter` - Creates a mock Express router

4. **Lambda Utilities:**
> These are incorrect; delete them
   - `createHandler` - Creates a mock Lambda handler
   - `mockLambdaContext` - Creates a mock Lambda context

5. **Environment Setup:**
> These are incorrect; delete them
   - `setupMockEnvironment` - Sets up the test environment
   - `teardownMockEnvironment` - Tears down the test environment

6. **Mongoose Utilities:**
> These are incorrect; delete them
   - `mockConnection` - Creates a mock database connection
   - `mockModel` - Creates mock Mongoose models

7. **Textract Utilities:**
> These are incorrect; delete them
   - `extractText` - Extracts text from documents
   - `extractForms` - Extracts form fields from documents
   - `extractTables` - Extracts tables from documents

## Implementation Differences

Several key implementation differences exist between the original and new mocks:

1. **Organization:**
   - The new implementation is more modular, with mocks separated by functionality
   - Better organized imports and exports
   - Uses utility functions for creating mocks with proper typing

2. **Mock Creation:**
   - The new implementation uses a `createMockFunction` utility that provides better TypeScript typing
   - The original implementation directly used vi.fn() with explicit type casting

3. **Return Values:**
   - The original mocks often returned specific mock values (e.g., `_MOCK_SECRET_[${TAG}]`)
   - The new mocks use more generic values and simpler implementations

4. **Error Handling:**
   - The original mocks often tried to use the original implementation first, then fell back to a mock
   - The new mocks provide direct mock implementations without trying the original first

5. **Testing Utilities:**
   - The new implementation adds explicit setup/teardown utilities for test environments
   - Includes better support for mocking Express, Lambda, and Mongoose

6. **Type Definitions:**
   - The new implementation generally has better TypeScript type definitions
   - Makes more use of generic types for function mocks

## Summary

The new mock implementation is a significant reorganization with both additions and omissions:

- **Missing Functionality:** Several functions from the original mock are missing, particularly error classes and core utilities
- **New Features:** Adds several new utilities for mocking Express, Lambda, and AWS services
- **Implementation Style:** More modular, better typed, and uses utility functions for creating mocks
- **Organization:** Better separation of concerns by module type (AWS, Express, etc.)

The missing functionality will need to be addressed, but the new structure provides a better foundation for future development and testing.
