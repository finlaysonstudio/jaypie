# Specification Review

Review this specification.
Is the goal of the specification clear?
ðŸ›‘ If the goal is not clear STOP and ask clarifying questions.
If there is a step-by-step breakdown (often `## Steps`) review it.
If there is no step-by-step breakdown, create one.
Steps should be iterative chunks that build on each other.
Tests should cover all new and altered functionality.
Use Reasoning to review these steps a second time.
Ensure steps are small enough to be implemented safely with strong testing and types.
Ensure steps are big enough to move the feature forward.
Iterate until the steps are right-sized for this request.
