Read plan.md.
Make sure the task section includes these instructions before the tasks:

* Tasks should be labeled _Queued_, _Dequeued_, and _Verified_
* Consider unlabeled tasks _Queued_
* Once development begins, mark a task _Dequeued_
* Do not move tasks to _Verified_ during the development process
* A separate verification process will tag tasks _Verified_
* The "first" or "next" task refers to the top-most _Queued_ task
* The "last" or "previous" task refers to the bottom-most _Dequeued_ task
* Only work on one task at a time
* Only work on the next task unless instructed to work on the last task
