# Write Efficient Prompt Guides

An efficient prompt conveys maximum information in minimal words.

## Process

If provided with an existing guide, update the guide.
Apply these standards dogmatically.
If provided content, create a new guide.

## Goals

* Apply a crisp, declarative writing style
* Consider how each phrase can be written for maximum clarity
* Remove superfluous language
* Remove tasks only a human can perform
* Prefer semantic meaning (like headings) and clarity over aesthetic concerns (like font size)

## Suggested Outline for a New Guide

```markdown
# Guide title

One-line overview of the guide's value

## Goal

Aim or "outputs" of the guide

## Guidelines

Assumptions and prerequisites factoring in the implementation

## Process

Setup and steps to reproduce
```

## üè† Studio House Style

Focus on clarity using terse and pithy language.
Place each sentence on its own line to enhance version control diffs.
Avoid the second-person pronoun; instructions may imply the reader without using ‚Äúyou.‚Äù
Reference abstract third persons when a party must be mentioned.
