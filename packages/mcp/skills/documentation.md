# Writing Style

Guidelines for writing Jaypie documentation.

## Audience

- Optimize for coding agents
- Expert humans prefer content written for agents
- Do not assume context, orient the reader
- Provide both minimal use cases and complete code examples

## Style

- Crisp, declarative writing
- Terse and pithy language
- Dry whimsy when appropriate
- Focus on clarity
- Maximum information in minimal words
- Active voice, present tense, imperative mood
- Avoid the second-person pronoun; instructions may imply the reader without using "you."
- Reference abstract third persons when a party must be mentioned
- Chicago Manual of Style
- Merriam-Webster Dictionary
