summary: JaypieNextJs supports domain-less CloudFront-only deployment
---

## Changes

- Added `domainProps: false` option to `JaypieNextJs` to deploy without a custom domain
- When `domainProps: false`, the application is accessible only via CloudFront URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is automatically set to the CloudFront distribution URL when no domain is configured
- Cache policy names use construct ID instead of domain name for domain-less deployments
