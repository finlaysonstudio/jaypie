summary: Fix grantManageConnections IAM permission

## Bug Fixes

### JaypieWebSocket.grantManageConnections

Fixed `grantManageConnections()` to grant the correct IAM permission for sending messages to WebSocket clients.

**Before**: The method generated an ARN without the `@connections` path, causing `AccessDeniedException` when Lambdas tried to use the API Gateway Management API.

**After**: The ARN now correctly includes `/POST/@connections/*` to match the required permission format.

Fixes #151
