summary: Fix JaypieNextJs Lambda timeout defaulting to 10 seconds instead of 900 seconds
---

## Bug Fix

- **JaypieNextJs timeout**: Lambda functions deployed via `JaypieNextJs` now default to 900 seconds (`CDK.DURATION.LAMBDA_WORKER`) instead of the 10-second default from `cdk-nextjs-standalone`. This fix applies to both the server function and image optimization function.

## Details

Previously, the `JaypieNextJs` construct did not pass a `timeout` property to the underlying `cdk-nextjs-standalone` Nextjs construct, causing Lambda functions to timeout after just 10 seconds. This was inconsistent with other Jaypie Lambda constructs like `JaypieQueuedLambda` which correctly defaulted to 900 seconds.

Fixes #162.
