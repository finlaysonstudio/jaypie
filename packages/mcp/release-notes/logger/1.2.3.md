summary: Fix DatadogLogTransport message field conflict with Datadog pipeline remapper
---

## Changes

- Fix `DatadogLogTransport.send()` to parse JSON strings and extract `message` as the Datadog message field
- Exclude `log` field from entries — level is already captured in `status`, and the `log` field conflicted with Datadog's pipeline remapper overwriting message content
- Spread extra structured fields (tags, data, etc.) as top-level Datadog entry attributes instead of double-serializing
- Non-JSON strings and JSON without a `message` field fall back to using the raw string
