## New Features

### Extended SkillRecord Schema

- `name`: Display title for the skill
- `nicknames`: Alternate lookup keys for `getByNickname()`
- `tags`: Categorization tags for filtering
- `includes`: Auto-expand other skill content on lookup

### Enhanced SkillStore Interface

- `getByNickname(nickname)`: Look up skills by alternate names
- `list(filter)`: Filter by namespace prefix or tag
- `search(term)`: Search across alias, name, description, content, and tags

### Include Expansion

New `expandIncludes(store, record)` utility that:
- Prepends included skills' content before the record's content
- Recursively expands nested includes
- Prevents circular references
- Skips missing includes silently
