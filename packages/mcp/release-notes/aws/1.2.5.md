summary: Add WebSocket connection management utilities

## New Features

### WebSocket Utilities

- **`sendToConnection(data, { connectionId, domainName, stage })`** - Send data to a WebSocket connection
- **`broadcastToConnections(data, { connectionIds, domainName, stage })`** - Broadcast data to multiple connections

Both functions use the ApiGatewayManagementApi client and handle stale connection errors gracefully.

## Dependencies

- Added `@aws-sdk/client-apigatewaymanagementapi`
