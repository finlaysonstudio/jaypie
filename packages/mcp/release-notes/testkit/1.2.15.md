summary: Removed vocabulary mocks, updated to fabric types
---

## Changes

- Removed `vocabulary` mock module (vocabulary package deprecated)
- Updated `IndexableEntity` type import to `IndexableModel` from `@jaypie/fabric`
- Removed `mock.vocabulary` exports from mock index

## Migration

If you were using vocabulary mocks, they are no longer needed as the functionality has moved to `@jaypie/fabric`:

```typescript
// Before
import { IndexableEntity } from "@jaypie/testkit/mock";

// After
import { IndexableModel } from "@jaypie/fabric";
```
