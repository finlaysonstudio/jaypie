summary: Improve CORS origin matching security with subdomain support
---

## Changes

- Fixed CORS security issue: origin matching now uses proper hostname extraction instead of `.includes()`
- Added subdomain matching: when `example.com` is allowed, subdomains like `app.example.com` are automatically allowed
- Added `extractHostname()` and `isOriginAllowed()` helpers for secure origin validation
- Origins in config can now be specified without protocol prefix (defaults to `https://`)

## Security

- Previously, allowing `example.com` would incorrectly allow `notexample.com` or `fakeexample.com` due to `.includes()` matching
- Now uses proper hostname extraction and suffix matching with dot separator to prevent this issue
