summary: Fix Lambda streaming hang for NO_CONTENT responses via expressHandler

# @jaypie/express 1.2.9

## Bug Fixes

- **Lambda streaming NO_CONTENT hang**: Fixed issue where `httpHandler(HTTP.CODE.NO_CONTENT)` routes would hang when using Lambda streaming. The previous fix (1.2.8) only addressed CORS OPTIONS requests; this extends the solution to all responses going through `expressHandler`.

## Technical Details

For Lambda streaming responses, `flushHeaders()` must be called before `send()`/`json()` to initialize `_wrappedStream`. Without this, the async `_final()` callback finds `_wrappedStream` null and the Lambda hangs.

The fix detects Lambda streaming responses by checking for `"_responseStream" in res`, which is unique to `LambdaResponseStreaming`.
