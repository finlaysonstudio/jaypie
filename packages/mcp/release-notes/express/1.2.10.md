summary: Fix Lambda streaming NO_CONTENT detection using Symbol marker
---

## Bug Fixes

- **#178**: Fixed Lambda streaming NO_CONTENT responses still hanging after previous fix
  - The `_responseStream` property check failed after Express's prototype manipulation
  - Now uses `JAYPIE_LAMBDA_STREAMING` Symbol marker for reliable detection
  - Matches the pattern used for `JAYPIE_LAMBDA_MOCK` in buffered responses
