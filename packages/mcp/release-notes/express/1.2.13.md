summary: Fix request stream not ending for GET requests without body in Lambda streaming mode
---

## Fixes

- **Lambda Streaming**: Fixed GET requests without a body hanging when using `createLambdaStreamHandler` with `expressHandler`. The issue was that the request stream never emitted 'end' for bodyless requests, causing middleware (like `express.json()`) that waits for the stream to hang forever.

## Technical Details

The `LambdaRequest` class now always schedules a `process.nextTick` to push `null` to the stream (signaling end), even for requests without a body. Previously, this was only done for requests WITH a body, leaving GET requests in a perpetual "waiting" state.

This fix complements the 1.2.12 fix - together they fully resolve issue #187:
- **1.2.12**: Fixed `safeSendJson` setting content-type before flushing headers
- **1.2.13**: Fixed request stream never ending for bodyless requests

Fixes #187
