summary: Add ESM Lambda deployment documentation to express, lambda, and cdk skills
---

## Documentation

- **express skill**: Added "Lambda ESM Bundling" section with full esbuild config for `.mjs` output
- **lambda skill**: Added "ESM Deployment" section explaining `.mjs` vs `package.json` approaches
- **cdk skill**: Added "Pre-built Code" section for JaypieLambda with `code` prop

## Key Pattern

Use `.mjs` extension for ESM Lambda bundles - Node.js always treats `.mjs` as ESM regardless of `package.json`.
