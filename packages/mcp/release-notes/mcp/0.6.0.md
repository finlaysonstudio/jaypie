summary: Remove list_providers command from LLM tool
---

## Breaking Changes

- Removed `list_providers` command from `llm` tool
- Removed `REASONING_MODELS` export from llm suite

## Rationale

The `list_providers` command provided metadata about available LLM providers and reasoning models. This information was largely static and better served by documentation. The `debug_call` command remains for actual LLM API testing.

## Migration

If you were using `llm("list_providers")`, refer to the help documentation instead:
- `llm()` or `llm("help")` returns available commands and provider information
