summary: Integrate @jaypie/tildeskill for skill storage abstraction

# @jaypie/mcp v0.7.0

## Changes

- **New dependency**: Uses `@jaypie/tildeskill` for skill management
- **Refactored skill service**: Migrated from inline implementation to tildeskill's `createMarkdownStore`
- **Improved validation**: Uses tildeskill's `isValidAlias()` and `normalizeAlias()` utilities

## Breaking Changes

None - API remains unchanged. The skill service still works exactly the same way.
