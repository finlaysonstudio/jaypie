summary: Fix fabricObject to pass through arbitrary objects instead of requiring value property
---

## Changes

- **Fix**: `fabricObject` now passes through arbitrary objects without requiring a `value` property
- **Fix**: `resolveFromObject` now passes through objects without `value` instead of throwing

## Background

Previously, when using `type: Object` in a `fabricService` input definition, objects without a `value` property would throw `BadRequestError: Object must have a value attribute`. This was problematic for tools like the Datadog MCP tool that accept arbitrary parameter objects like `{ query: "...", from: "now-1h" }`.

The fix allows:
- Objects with `value` property: extracted as before
- Objects without `value` property: passed through as-is
- Scalars and arrays: still wrapped in `{ value: ... }`

This change follows the "fabric philosophy" - things that feel right should work.
