version: 0.1.4
date: 2025-01-20
summary: Added ServiceSuite bridge for MCP servers
---

## Changes

- Added `getServiceFunctions()` method to `ServiceSuite` - returns all registered service functions for transport adapters
- Added `getServiceFunction(name)` method to `ServiceSuite` - returns a specific service function by name
- Added `createMcpServerFromSuite()` function in `@jaypie/fabric/mcp` - creates FabricMcpServer from a ServiceSuite
- New type: `CreateMcpServerFromSuiteConfig`

## Usage

ServiceSuites now connect directly to MCP servers:

```typescript
import { createServiceSuite, fabricService } from "@jaypie/fabric";
import { createMcpServerFromSuite } from "@jaypie/fabric/mcp";

const suite = createServiceSuite({ name: "my-suite", version: "1.0.0" });
suite.register(myService, "category");

// Create MCP server from suite
const server = createMcpServerFromSuite(suite);
// All suite services are now registered as MCP tools

// Access service functions directly
const functions = suite.getServiceFunctions();
const specific = suite.getServiceFunction("my-service");
```

## Architecture

This enables a pattern where services are defined once and deployed to multiple transports:

```
fabricService() → ServiceSuite → createMcpServerFromSuite() → MCP Server
                              → FabricHttpServer → HTTP/Lambda
                              → FabricRouter → Express
```
