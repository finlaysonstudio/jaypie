summary: Add retry for transient network errors across all LLM providers
---

## Changes

- Add `isTransientNetworkError` utility that detects low-level Node.js/undici network errors (ECONNRESET, ETIMEDOUT, etc.) by inspecting error codes, messages, and the `error.cause` chain
- Integrate transient network error detection into all four provider adapters (Anthropic, Gemini, OpenAI, OpenRouter) so network errors are classified as retryable instead of unknown
- Add retry logic to `StreamLoop` for connection-level failures before any chunks are yielded; mid-stream failures emit an error chunk instead of throwing
