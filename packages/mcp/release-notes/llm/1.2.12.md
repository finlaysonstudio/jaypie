summary: Defense-in-depth against stale socket errors (ECONNRESET) across all adapters
---

## Changes

- Forward `AbortSignal` to Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini SDK calls (OpenRouter already had this)
- Add post-abort error suppression in all four adapters to swallow stale socket errors
- Install `unhandledRejection` guard during retry sleep in RetryExecutor and StreamLoop
- Fixes #209: TypeError: terminated (ECONNRESET) crashes despite RetryExecutor
