summary: Rename Google LLM provider from "gemini" to "google"

## Changes

- Canonical provider name changed from `"gemini"` to `"google"`
- `"gemini"` is still accepted as a legacy alias with a deprecation warning
- Provider auto-detection from model names continues to work (e.g., `gemini-3-pro-preview` → `"google"`)
