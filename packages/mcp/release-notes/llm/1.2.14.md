summary: Rename Google LLM provider to "google", fix model dropped when passed as first arg
---

## Changes

- Canonical provider name changed from `"gemini"` to `"google"`
- `"gemini"` is still accepted as a legacy alias with a deprecation warning
- Provider auto-detection from model names continues to work (e.g., `gemini-3-pro-preview` → `"google"`)
- Fix: `new Llm("gemini-3-flash-preview")` now preserves the model instead of falling back to provider default (#213)
