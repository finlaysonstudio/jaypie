summary: Preserve original error details in BadGatewayError thrown by RetryExecutor
---

## Changes

### Bug Fixes

- **Preserve original error message in BadGatewayError**: When `RetryExecutor` encounters a non-retryable error or exhausts retries, it now preserves the original error message in the thrown `BadGatewayError`. Previously, the original error details (e.g., "Quota exceeded for metric X, limit: 0") were lost, making debugging difficult.

### Before

```
JaypieError: An unexpected error occurred on an upstream resource
```

### After

```
JaypieError: You exceeded your current quota... limit: 0
```

This fix improves debugging by preserving context from LLM provider errors (like Gemini's 429 quota exceeded responses).
