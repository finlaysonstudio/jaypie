# Jaypie 🐦‍⬛

Event-driven fullstack architecture centered around JavaScript, AWS, and the JSON:API specification

"JavaScript on both sides and underneath"

## 🐦‍⬛ Introduction

Jaypie is an opinionated approach to application development centered around JavaScript and the JSON:API specification in an event-driven architecture.

Jaypie is suited for applications that require custom infrastructure beyond HTTP requests (e.g., message queues). Without custom infrastructure, fullstack hosts like Vercel or Netlify are recommended.

### "Jaypie Stack"

* AWS infrastructure managed by CDK in Node.js
* Express server running on AWS Lambda
* Node.js worker processes running on AWS Lambda
* MongoDB via Mongoose
* Vue ecosystem frontend: Vue 3 composition, Vuetify, Pinia
* Vitest for testing
* ES6 syntax enforced via ESLint
* Prettier formatting
* JSON logging with custom metadata

### Philosophy

Jaypie is for JavaScript developers building fullstack applications. 

#### JavaScript Only

Jaypie uses the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) to manage infrastructure, which is written in Node.js. This makes managing infrastructure accessible to the fullstack developer without learning a new syntax and living without language constructs like loops and inheritance.

Does NOT use Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, or the "Serverless" framework. 

#### Eject Anything

Jaypie embraces "ejectability," the philosophy that any part of the framework can be removed (and therefore replaced) without disturbing the whole.

#### Mockable Everywhere

Jaypie strives to be "mockable-first" meaning all components should be easily tested via default or provided mocks.
