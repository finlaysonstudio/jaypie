# Jaypie 🐦‍⬛

Event-driven fullstack architecture centered around JavaScript, AWS, and the JSON:API specification

"JavaScript on both sides and underneath"

## 🐦‍⬛ Introduction

Jaypie is an opinionated approach to application development centered around JavaScript and the JSON:API specification in an event-driven architecture

Jaypie embraces "ejectability," the philosophy that any part of the framework can be removed (and therefore replaced) without disturbing the whole. Jaypie strives to be "mockable-first" meaning all components should be easily tested via default or provided mocks

The "Jaypie Stack" includes:

* AWS infrastructure managed by CDK in Node.js
* Express server running on AWS Lambda
* Node.js worker processes running on AWS Lambda
* MongoDB via Mongoose
* Vue ecosystem frontend: Vue 3 composition, Vuetify, Pinia
* Vitest for testing
* ES6 syntax enforced via ESLint
* Prettier formatting
* JSON logging with custom metadata
